->To setup codeignitor project in local

1.install xaamp 
2.install 7.4  php
3.place the project of codeignitor in the "C:\xampp\htdocs" path
4.the project must contain application , system , api , js , css, .htaccess and index.php inside main folder 
5.create a empty database in myphpadmin and import the database data in the empty created and go to config on apache in xaamp control panel and select php.int and increase value of memory_limit=256M,upload_max_filesize=512m,post_max_size=512m, max_execution_time=3600
6.inside application/config config.php file is present open the file and add url to the project present in the file manager in $config['base_url'] =""; 
7.inside application/config database.php file is present open the file and add details according to the database created 
         'hostname' => 'localhost',
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => '', 
	'database' => 'school',
8.the project folder must contain structure similar to 
your_project/
├── application/
├── backend
├── system/
├── uploads        <-- System folder
├── index.php
├── .htaccess
9.replace code present in .htaccess inside the mainfolder with 
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:\xampp\htdocs\school"
    ServerName myproject.local
</VirtualHost>
10. start the xaamp and run the apache and mysql and run the url assigned in the code and the project will be loaded.

->To add the code to the github repository
Step 1: Initialize a New Git Repository

1.Open a terminal or command prompt.

2.Navigate to the root directory of your CodeIgniter project: cd /path/to/your/codeigniter/project

3.Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder: git init

Step 2: Stage Your Files

1.Add all the files and directories in your CodeIgniter project to the staging area: git add .

Step 3: Commit Your Changes

1.Commit the staged changes with a meaningful commit message: git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 4: Add a Remote Repository (GitHub)

1.If you haven't already created a repository on GitHub, follow the steps outlined in the previous response to create a GitHub repository.

2.Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository.

3.Add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local Git repository: git remote add origin <repository_url> and replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied from GitHub.

Step 5: Push Your Code to GitHub

1.Push your local Git repository to GitHub: git push -u origin master

This command pushes your code to the "master" branch of your GitHub repository. If you have a different branch, replace "master" with the appropriate branch name.

After completing these steps, your CodeIgniter project should be successfully added to Git and pushed to your GitHub repository.
